### Natural Language Processing: Model Comparison between BERT and Hierarchical Attention Networks
This project two natural language processing models on a dataset composed of labeled propaganda data. We reviewed off the shelf BERT and the Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) models and found they both provide different accuracy levels, with BERT maintaining better results for the binary data classification problem.
